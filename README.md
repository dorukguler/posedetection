This project is about using golden ratio to detect human body parts.Detecting them with mediapipe and then using 
those points to calculate golden ratio in the body seemed practically impossible since the ratio changed a lot according to how close that person is to the camera.
But you can see our work from here.

<h3>#How to run</h3>
Firstly run this:

<code>
pip install -r requirements.txt
</code>

This will make sure you have all the libraries installed. 
Later you can run, posemodule.py to get the results of golden ratio.
<h4>#TO DO:</h4>
Detect person's distance from the camera and calculate the ratios according to it.
Maybe improve windowmanager class.
